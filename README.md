# Exam Results Notifier â€“ University Automation Script

ðŸ“¢ **Automation Script** built to solve a very specific but important student problem:  
At my university, exam results were published **without any prior announcement or schedule**.  
They would just appear suddenly on the portal â€” which meant every student had to keep checking the website manually again and again.  

Instead of wasting time refreshing the page, I designed this system to check automatically and send me an **email notification** as soon as the results were available.

## âš¡ How It Works
1. Connects to the university portal and checks if results are posted.  
2. If results are found â†’ an **email notification** is sent with the details.  
3. Keeps running on schedule to check continuously.  
4. Deployed on a **server** so it runs automatically without manual execution.

## ðŸ˜‚ Fun Note
This project started because we never knew *when* results would show up.  
Instead of being glued to the portal, I let automation do the waiting for me.  
Now I only check my inbox â€” not the university website!
